# International-Student-Enrollment-Trends


## OVERVIEW

International student mobility is defined as the proportion of enrolled foreign students to all students in a given country. More than a million international students, or nearly 6% of all students, are enrolled in US universities, despite a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these students are from over 227 different countries, a significant percentage of them are from China and India.

##OBJECTIVE AND SCORPE

The purpose of the project is to look into trends and patterns related to international students who are enrolled in American universities. We analyze publicly available datasets using SQL and Python to find out what influences study fields, graduation rates, international student enrollment, and regional preferences. By providing insights into the state of education, the analysis assists universities in tailoring their curricula to meet the needs of a diverse range of students.

##fINDING OUT PATTERS AND INSIGHTS 

1. Identifying Trends in Enrollment: Monitor changes in the quantity of overseas students over time and pinpoint the factors that influence these trends, such as modifications to visa policies or changes in the status of the economy.
2. Regional Preferences: Examine international students' regional preferences to ascertain which states or regions have greater enrollment rates.
3. Analysis of Field of Study: Find out which subjects are most popular among international students and assess how students' interests have evolved over time.
4. Graduation Rates: Evaluate the graduation rates of international students along with the factors that affect their success or lack thereof in the classroom.
