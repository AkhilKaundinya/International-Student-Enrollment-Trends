# International-Student-Enrollment-Trends
## OVERVIEW
International student mobility is defined as the proportion of enrolled foreign students to all students in a given country. More than a million international students, or nearly 6% of all students, are enrolled in US universities, despite a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these students are from over 227 different countries, a significant percentage of them are from China and India.
